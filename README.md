AuthorityController [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/efficiently/authority-controller.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/efficiently/authority-controller)
===================

AuthorityController is an PHP authorization library for [Laravel 5.0 & 5.1](http://laravel.com) and [Lumen] (http://lumen.laravel.com/) which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access.

All permissions are defined in a single location:

    config/authority-controller.php

and not duplicated across controllers, routes, views, and database queries.

For [**Laravel 4.1 or 4.2**](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2) supports see [AuthorityController 1.2 branch](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/tree/1.2)

#### Lumen Support
For Lumen support, follow the instructions below for the most part, but as Lumen doesn't support config publishing you'll not be able to run php artisan vendor:publish for example, and some of the config is done a little different.

You will need to manually copy the migrations in to your migrations folder from
 ```php
 vendor/efficiently/authority-controller/src/migrations/ to your migrations folder and the config from vendor/efficiently/authority-controller/src/config/config.php to config/authority-controller.php.
 ```
Register the aliases (in bootstrap/app.php), notice you'll need to add the Lang alias too.

 ```php
 class_alias('Efficiently\AuthorityController\Facades\Params', 'Params');
 class_alias('Efficiently\AuthorityController\Facades\Authority', 'Authority');
 class_alias('Illuminate\Support\Facades\Lang', 'Lang');
 ```
Lumen will not automatically load the config file so this will need adding to bootstrap/app.php too

 ```php
 $app->configure('authority-controller');
 ```
#### Demo application

You can see in action this package with this Laravel 5.1 [**demo application**](https://github.com/efficiently/laravel_authority-controller_app#readme).

#### Origins and Inspirations

It's an extension of the [`authority-laravel`](https://github.com/authority-php/authority-laravel) package.

And a port of the best [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) authorization library: [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan).

[Authority](https://github.com/authority-php/authority) ports some features of CanCan and this package ports [_almost_](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/blob/master/README.md#missing-features) all the other features.

Installation
---------------------------

#### With [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

1. Add `authority-controller` package to your `composer.json` file to require AuthorityController:

 ```bash
 composer require efficiently/authority-controller:dev-master
 ```

2. Add the service provider to `config/app.php`:

 ```php
     'Efficiently\AuthorityController\AuthorityControllerServiceProvider',
 ```

3. Add the aliases (facades) to your Laravel app config file:

 ```php
     'Params'    => 'Efficiently\AuthorityController\Facades\Params',
     'Authority' => 'Efficiently\AuthorityController\Facades\Authority',
 ```

4. This will allow you to access the Authority class through the static interface you are used to with Laravel components.

 ```php
 Authority::can('update', 'SomeModel');
 ```

Configuration
-------------
##### Create Roles and Permissions Tables

We have provided a basic table structure to get you started in creating your roles and permissions.

Publish them to your migrations directory or copy them directly.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Efficiently\AuthorityController\AuthorityControllerServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

Run the migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the following tables

- roles
- role_user
- permissions

To utilize these tables, you can add the following methods to your `User` model. You will also need to create Role and Permission Model stubs (replacing `App\Authority\` with you own namespace)..

```php
    //app/User.php
    public function roles()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('App\Authority\Role');
    }

    public function permissions()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Authority\Permission');
    }

    public function hasRole($key)
    {
        $hasRole = false;
        foreach ($this->roles as $role) {
            if ($role->name === $key) {
                $hasRole = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        return $hasRole;
    }
```

```php
    //app/Authority/Role.php
    <?php namespace App\Authority;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

    class Role extends Model {}
```

```php
    //app/Authority/Permission.php
    <?php namespace App\Authority;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

    class Permission extends Model {}
```

##### Init resource filters and controller methods
In your `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` file, add the `ControllerAdditions` trait and disable the use of the `AuthorizesRequests` trait:

```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\DispatchesJobs;
use Illuminate\Routing\Controller as BaseController;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Validation\ValidatesRequests;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\Access\AuthorizesRequests;
use Efficiently\AuthorityController\ControllerAdditions as AuthorityControllerAdditions;

abstract class Controller extends BaseController
{
    // use AuthorizesRequests;
    use DispatchesJobs, ValidatesRequests;
    use AuthorityControllerAdditions;
    //code...
}
```

**NB:** If you really need the default Laravel Authorization system, you can use the `AuthorizesRequests` trait, if you alias its `authorize` method, like this:

```php
<?php
//code...
abstract class Controller extends BaseController
{
    //code...
    use AuthorizesRequests, AuthorityControllerAdditions {
        AuthorityControllerAdditions::authorize insteadof AuthorizesRequests;
        AuthorizesRequests::authorize as illuminateAuthorize;
    }
    //code...
}
```

Getting Started
---------------
AuthorityController expects that `Auth::user()` return the current authenticated user. Now, by default Laravel 5 handles [this](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/authentication#retrieving-the-authenticated-user).

##### Defining Authority rules

User permissions are defined in an AuthorityController configuration file.

You can publish the AuthorityController default configuration file with the command below:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Efficiently\AuthorityController\AuthorityControllerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This will place a copy of the configuration file at `config/authority-controller.php`. The config file includes an `initialize` function, which is a great place to setup your rules and aliases.

```php
//config/authority-controller.php

return [
    'initialize' => function($authority) {
        $user = Auth::guest() ? new App\User : $authority->getCurrentUser();

        // Action aliases. For example:
        $authority->addAlias('moderate', ['read', 'update', 'delete']);

        // Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
        if ($user->hasRole('admin')) {
            $authority->allow('manage', 'all');
        } else {
            $authority->allow('read', 'all');
        }
    }
];
```

See [Defining Authority rules](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/wiki/Defining-Authority-rules) for details.

##### Check Authority rules & Authorization

The current user's permissions can then be checked using the `Authority::can()` and `Authority::cannot()` methods in the view and controller.

```
@if (Authority::can('update', $article))
    {{ link_to_route("articles.edit", "Edit", $article->id) }}
@endif
```

See [Checking Authority rules](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/wiki/Checking-Authority-rules) for more information

The `authorize()` method in the controller will throw an exception if the user is not able to perform the given action.

```php
public function show($id)
{
    $this->article = App\Article::find($id);
    $this->authorize('read', $this->article);
}
```

Setting this for every action can be tedious, therefore the `loadAndAuthorizeResource()` method is provided to automatically authorize all actions in a RESTful style resource controller. It will use a before filter to load the resource into an instance variable and authorize it for every action.

```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class ArticlesController extends Controller
{

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->loadAndAuthorizeResource();
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
        // $this->article is already loaded and authorized
    }
}
```

See [Authorizing Controller Actions](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/wiki/authorizing-controller-actions) for more information.

##### Exception Handling

The `Efficiently\AuthorityController\Exceptions\AccessDenied` exception is thrown when calling `authorize()` in the controller and the user is not able to perform the given action. A message can optionally be provided.

```php
Authority::authorize('read', 'App\Product', 'Unable to read this product.');
```

You can catch the exception and modify its behavior in the `render()` method of the `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` file. For example here we set the error message to a flash and redirect to the home page.

```php
//app/Exceptions/Handler.php

   /**
    * Render an exception into an HTTP response.
    *
    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
    * @param  \Exception  $e
    * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
    */
    public function render($request, Exception $e)
    {
        //code...
        if ($e instanceof \Efficiently\AuthorityController\Exceptions\AccessDenied) {
            $msg = $e->getMessage();
            \Log::error('Access denied! '.$msg);

            return redirect('/home')->with('flash_alert', $msg);
        }

        return parent::render($request, $e);
    }

    //code...
```

Controller additions
--------------------
Your controllers have now a `$params` property:

```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class ProductsController extends Controller
{
    //code...

    public function update($id)
    {
        $this->params['id'] == $id;//-> true
        $this->params['product'];//-> ["name" => "Best movie"]
        $this->params['controller'];//-> 'products'
        $this->params['action'];//-> 'update'
        //code...
    }

    //code...
}
```

Missing features
----------------
1. In `ControllerResource` class, the [`#load_collection`](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/1.6.10/lib/cancan/controller_resource.rb#L80) method, who uses in the `User` model [`#accessible_by`](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/1.6.10/lib/cancan/model_additions.rb#L22) method. Looks complicated.
  Instead, use specific query scopes with `collectionScope` option to filtering your data in your collection (e.g. `index`) controller actions.
  Because you'll allowing/denying access by roles or check user's authorizations on each record of the collection.
2. In `Ability` class, the [`#attributes_for`](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/1.6.10/lib/cancan/ability.rb#L221) method.
  Looks useless with `Authority` because rules conditions are only possible by `Closure` not by associative array. And CanCan handles `#attribute_for` only for `Hash` (associative array) conditions.
3. `#skip_*` methods in `ControllerAdditions`.
4. For `allow()` and `deny()` methods of `Authority`, the third argument isn't an optional hash (associative array) of conditions but an anonymous function (Closure):

```php
$authority->allow('update', 'App\Product', function ($self, $product) {
    return $product->available === true;
});
```

Good to know
------------
#### Compatibility
It's **only** compatible with **PHP >= 5.4** and **Laravel >= 4.1** framework.

#### Differences between CanCan and AuthorityController

Questions or Problems?
----------------------
If you have any issues with AuthorityController, please add an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/efficiently/authority-controller/issues) or fork the project and send a pull request.

To get the tests running you should install PHPUnit and run `phpunit tests`.


Special Thanks
--------------
AuthorityController was _heavily_ inspired by [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) and uses [Authority-Laravel](https://github.com/authority-php/authority-laravel).
